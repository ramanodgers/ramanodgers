### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, this is Raman Odgers

I am a CS masters student at Columbia University, focusing on ML and AI. I recently graduated from the University of Chicago where I studied Economics, Physics and Computer Science. I've worked in quantum computing, deep tech and venture capital, but I am now focused on *applying bespoke AI technology to narrow domain problems, as well as AGI capability research.*

This new github account is a work in progress to centralise projects new and old.
